# master_code_interview

This is me on testing my code and algo skills and trying to build my mussles in preparation for Coding Interview with Google, Amazon,Facebook etc.

Decided to stretch myself and get to implement my own Hash Table and code all the most famous sorting algo around.

Everything is TDD tested (something you will not find on any prec code text books).

Enjoy.

# master_code_interview

This is me on testing my code and algo skills and trying to build my mussles in preparation for Coding Interview with Google, Amazon,Facebook etc.

You will find the implementation of all the Data Structure around but:
Stacks
Queues
Graphs.

The reason is that you can implement them by urself using:
Tree, LinkedList and Array, provided by me.

Decided to stretch myself and get to implement my own Hash Table and code all the most famous sorting algo around.

Everything is TDD tested (something you will not find on any prep code text books).


Enjoy.
